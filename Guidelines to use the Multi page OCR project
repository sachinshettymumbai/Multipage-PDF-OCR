This python code will help if you perform OCR on a multiple page PDF.
In this project , I am searching for 3 specific values in each page of the PDF and writing it to a csv file.
Each page in the PDF is a scanned image. The code first breaks the PDF into multiple image files(i.e. if there are 5 pages in the PDF then 5 image files are created)
Then OCR is performed on each of the image file and the 3 searched values(per image file) are appended to a csv file.

There are some important python librares which need to be installed before you run the code.

Pillow, PDF2Image and Pytesseract libraries need to installed using pip command
Poppler for Windows is also required for the project. The poppler folder is present in the project folder and the path is referenced in the PDFToExcel.py file

Main.pdf(multi page pdf) is part of the project folder.

You can modify the python code as per your requirement to search for specific values/values and store them to a csv or excel file.
